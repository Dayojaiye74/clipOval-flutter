#Flutter UI and Designs Examples 

In this repository I will be creating useful examples in Flutter to help improve your app performances :100:

If this is helpful feel free to fork and star the repo :smiley: :hug:

Demo(s) shown below :down:

## Clip Oval Demo

A widget that clips its child using an oval.

By default, inscribes an axis-aligned oval into its layout dimensions and prevents its child from painting outside that oval, but the size and location of the clip oval can be customized using a custom clipper.
